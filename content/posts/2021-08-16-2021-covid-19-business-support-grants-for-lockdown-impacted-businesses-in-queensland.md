Your business or not-for-profit organisation may be eligible for a $5,000 grant if you're impacted by the Queensland lockdowns that commenced at 4pm, Saturday 31 July 2021. Businesses and not-for-profit organisations outside of these lockdown areas may also be eligible. 

**Applications open 12pm (midday), 16 August 2021.**  

One of the eligibility rules is that businesses must show or declare a reduction in turnover of 30% or more for a 1-week period that includes at least 1 full day during the lock down periods in Queensland.

Applications are lodged through the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority (QRIDA) portal with supporting documents after businesses have created a QRIDA profile.  Businesses can choose their main supporting document to be an Independent Accountant’s letter to verify eligibility and turnover requirements.  Please note the Queensland government website link below with all the details.  

However, please contact our office should you wish to discuss and require assistance with the application including an Independent Accountant’s letter which we can assist with.
