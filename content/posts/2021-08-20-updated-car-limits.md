There are updated car threshold amounts from 1 July as follows;

* Income Tax:

1. The car limit for 2021-22 is $60,733
2. This means that the upper limit on the cost you use to calculate depreciation for the business use is $60,733 if the car was purchased in the 2021-22 year

* Goods and services tax (GST):

1. If you purchase a car, the maximum amount of GST you can claim is one-eleventh of the car limit, which amounts to $5,521 in the 2021-22 year. This applies even if the cost of the car exceeds the car limit
2. You cannot claim GST credit for any luxury car tax, regardless of the business % usage. 

* Luxury Car Tax (LCT):

1. The threshold for LCT has increased to $69,152 from 1 July 2021
2. For fuel efficient cards, the threshold has increased to $79,659 for the 2021-22 financial year
3. Note that the value of the car generally includes parts, accessories and attachments supplied or imported at the same time
