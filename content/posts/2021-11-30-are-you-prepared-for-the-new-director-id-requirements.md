A recent initiative by the Commonwealth Government to promote ethical corporate conduct has seen the introduction of the new Director Identification regime under the *Treasury Laws Amendment Act 2020*. All eligible directors will be issued with a unique 15-diget identification number that they will be required to keep forever. 

The purpose of the new ID system is to improve director transparency by making it easier to trace a director’s relationship across companies and prevent the use of false identities, illegal phoenix arrangements and other unlawful activity. 

**Who will require a Director ID?**
If you are a director (or acting in the capacity of an alternate director) for any of the following entity categories, you will need to apply for a director ID:
•	A company (with an ACN);
•	An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation;
•	A corporate trustee 
•	A charity or not-for-profit organisation that is a company or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation;
•	Registered Australian body (with an ABRN) 
•	A foreign company who carrying on business in Australia and is registered with ASIC (regardless of where that individual lives).\

**When will a director need to apply by?**\
When you became, or when you intend to become, a director will determine when you need to apply. 

Applications are open from 2 November 2021.

**How to apply:**\
From 1 November 2021 directors will be able to apply for their Director ID by visiting the [Australian Business Registry Services (ABRS) website.](https://www.abrs.gov.au/director-identification-number)

In order to submit an application, a director will first need to have a myGovID. For more information about setting up your myGovID please see the following link - [Australian Government - How to set up your myGovID.](https://www.mygovid.gov.au/set-up)\

All applications must be completed by the director themselves as there are proof of identity requirements that cannot be completed on an individual’s behalf.
