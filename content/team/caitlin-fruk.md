I gained my Bachelor of Accounting in 2013 and my CPA in 2017. I began my career in Rockhampton where I specialised in working with clients operating primary production activities in the agricultural sector. I made the move down to the Brisbane to be closer to family and seek more career opportunities and in the process I fell in love with the beaches and the people of the Gold Coast. 

I’ve been told that I bring with me the country values of family, hard work and perseverance. I have experience with taxation reporting and compliance for individuals, SME’s, SMSF’s, bookkeeping and payroll over a variety of industries. My hobbies include knitting, cross-stitch, sewing (pretty well anything crafty), hiking, dining out and going to the beach
